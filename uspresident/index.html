    <img src="images/judicial.jpg"width="480"/>
    <h3> Evaluates laws (Supreme Court and other courts) </h3>
    <p>
      Courts decide arguments about the meaning of laws and how they are applied. They also decide if laws violate the Constitution—this is known as judicial review, and it is how federal courts provide checks and balances on the legislative and executive branches. </p>

  <section>
    <h1> Legislative Branch </h1>
    <img src="images/legislative.jpg"/>
    <h3> Makes laws (Congress) </h3>
    <p>
     	Article I of the Constitution establishes the legislative or lawmaking branch of government. It has a bicameral, or two-house Congress—the Senate and the House of Representatives—and agencies that support Congress. </p>
